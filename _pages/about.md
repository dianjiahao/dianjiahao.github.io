Hi, I am **Jiahao Dian (典家豪)**, a second-year Master's student at the **School of Geosciences and Info-Physics, Central South University**, majoring in Resources and Environment (Surveying Engineering).

My research interests lie in **Mountain Glacier Instability**, specifically utilizing multi-source remote sensing (InSAR, optical) and numerical modeling (Elmer/Ice) to understand glacier collapse mechanisms and invert subglacial parameters. I am passionately exploring the *thermal-hydrological-mechanical* coupling processes of glaciers in the High Mountain Asia region.

I have extensive field experience in the **Qinghai-Tibet Plateau**, including drone surveying and GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) measurements at Anyemaqen and Bukadaban Peak.

I am currently looking for academic collaborations or research assistant positions related to cryospheric science.

#### **Research Interests**
* **Remote Sensing Monitoring:** Glacier surface velocity, thickness change, and collapse early warning using InSAR & Feature Tracking.
* **Numerical Modeling:** Ice dynamics simulation (Full-Stokes), basal friction inversion, and stability assessment.
* **Deep Learning:** Application in glacial lake identification and glacier boundary extraction.
